        <p class="seventeen">I reached Boston at 6:55 P.M local time, immediately checking into my apartment. I was staying in an off campus apartment alone, my parents thought the privacy and comfort of an apartment would be better than standard college dorms. My apartment was only fifteen minutes away from university, so there wasn’t much travel time. Speaking of travel, I had to buy a car soon, traveling to anywhere would be impossible without one. Personally, I wasn’t so sure if staying completely alone was a great thing but I didn’t really have much of an option anymore. I unlocked the door, and scanned the place. It was absolutely massive, way bigger than one person could ever need. The place was beautiful, on the fourteenth floor of a newly built residential complex. I unpacked some of my stuff, washed my face and freshened up. I decided to talk a walk across town just to take in some sights, the chilly wind blowing right into my eyes. I smiled thankful, that I had packed proper winter clothing, I had heard winters were hard over here unlike the perpetual burning desert that was California. I pushed my wallet into my grey jacket, and I left the house apprehensively. It was dark when I left the house, there was a certain gloom descended over the city. 
</p>
<p class="seventeen">I took a cab to the heart of the city, and walked around the central square. I was looking down at my phone, when I collided into someone accidently. The man apologized, and walked off in the opposite direction. He was scruffy, his hair grey and unkempt. His clothes were patched and his face unshaven. I shook my head, and continued walking sternly telling myself to pay attention. I kept walking around the city for more than an hour, and by the time I had decided that I had done enough walking for the day, I realized that I had absolutely no idea how to reach home. Every corner looked the same to my untrained eyes, I decided to call a cab, and go back home. My hand went to my jacket pocket where I had kept my wallet, I couldn’t feel anything there. I searched my jacket again, I was quite sure this was where I had kept it. I was starting to panic now, the wallet had money, my license and even a few receipts I had stored in there as a memory. I was nostalgic and emotional in that sort of way, I collected certain things important to me. I think I had been pickpocketed on my very first evening in Boston. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry about this utter embarrassment. While I was busy walking with my phone that scruffy man had managed to run off with my wallet, there was almost something poetic about my incompetence. I didn’t have any money now to take a cab home, and I didn’t know the way back home. I realized that I had no option, but to call Ryan up and ask him to pick me up.</p> 

<p class="seventeen">I don't know for how long exactly I've known Ryan, he's been around as far as I can remember. He's been there with me in nearly every childhood memory I can imagine. Riding my first bike? He was learning how to ride one right next to me. First rejection by a girl? Ryan was right there telling me how she “wasn't all that great anyways” at the wee age of twelve. We grew up as kids, along the sunny coast of California a few miles away from each other, me in Cupertino, him in Morgan Hill. From Pokémon, to Soccer we played it all together. Ryan had a little sister too, Rebecca who was five years younger than him. Our parents had been friends since around the time we both were born and always had house parties and barbecues together. Ryan, essentially was a part of my extended family in California. Knowing that he would be with me in Boston was a slight morale booster, and today I got my first taste of that. Ryan pulled up in his car ten minutes later smirking. “Don’t tell me you got robbed on literally your first trip outside in the city.” He said snickering at me. I rolled my eyes and told him that I hadn’t really expected to be accosted by pickpockets on my first evening here. “Expect for the worst here, this is Boston my friend.”</p>
